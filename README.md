# CVXPY DNLP Differentiation Engine

This repository contains a **C implementation of the differentiation engine used by CVXPY** for its extension to **Disciplined Nonlinear Programming** ([DNLP])(https://github.com/cvxgrp/DNLP).

The library provides low-level routines for computing derivatives required by nonlinear programming problems. 
The library is intended as a **backend component** and is not meant to be used directly by end users.
