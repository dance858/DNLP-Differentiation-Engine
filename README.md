1. power should be double
2. can we reuse calculations, like in hessian of logistic
3. more tests for chain rule elementwise univariate hessian
4. in the refactor, add consts
5. multiply with one constant vector/scalar argument
6. AX where X is a matrix. Can that happen? How is that canonicalized? Maybe it can't happen.
